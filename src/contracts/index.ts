// `phoebe-agent/contracts` — the pure-TypeScript types every reader of a
// deployment shares: the engine and bootstrapper on the host, the relay, the
// web console, and the companion's renderer process (map #497, #521 §3).
//
// Two rules hold this subpath together, and purity.test.ts enforces both:
//
//  1. Nothing reachable from here imports a Node built-in. A browser bundle has
//     no `node:fs`; one such import anywhere in the closure and the whole
//     subpath stops loading in a renderer.
//  2. Nothing under this directory imports a value from outside it. Types erase
//     at build time; a value import would drag engine code — and the built-ins
//     behind it — along with it.
//
// So contracts holds type declarations and the occasional pure constant, and
// nothing that reaches a filesystem, a process, or a socket. Host code keeps
// importing these files from `src/` directly; the subpath export exists for
// everyone who installs the package instead.
//
// A runtime value added here has to be mirrored by hand in index.mjs. Node
// refuses to type-strip a `.ts` file under a `node_modules` segment, so an
// installed consumer's value import lands on the `.mjs`, never on this file.
